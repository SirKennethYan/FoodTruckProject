# FoodTruck Application

# Description of Project
This is a Java application that creates a Foodtruck array and allows the user to input the name, food type, and rating of the Foodtrucks. The application then displays all the created Foodtrucks, the average rating, the highest rated Foodtruck, and allows the user to select a Foodtruck by its number to display a menu.

# Technologies Used
Java, Eclipse, Slack, Github, Sublime, & Coffee.

# Lessons Learned
The biggest lesson I learned from this is remember the basics and try not to overthink every single thing. I struggled greeatly on this project and required the help of 3 different TA's to assit me along the way. At first, I could not fully wrap my head around how my method createTrucks(); actually created trucks in an array, but once I was able to picture it other things started to make sense. I need to better learn how to comprehend the instructions into steps and write out the logic in plain english.
